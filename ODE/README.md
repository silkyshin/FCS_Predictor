# Oligomerization models
onetosix - linear oligomerization mode - 1-2-3-4-5-6  
dhigher - dimer-higher oligomer model - 1-2-4-8  
evenorder - even order oligomerization model - 1-2-4-6  
trimer - trimer nucleation oligomerization model - 1-3-6  

## Suffixes
fr - forward and reverse reaction rates are separate parameters  
feq - forward reaction rates and equilibrium constants are parameters  
assoc - forward reaction rate of k1 is a parameter, other forward reaction rates are assumed to be the same and defined as k_assoc. Equilibrium constants are parameters too.
